<!-- Note: The code is quick, fast and hacky -->
<!-- 
        A simple snake-like-game where the player controls a snake. 
        The aim is to grow the snake by eating the apple. 
        The more apples you eat the longer the snake gets and thus, the harder the game becomes the more apples the snake eats.
